## Billing Enabled Compulsory
**Required for running this action**
This action uses Firebase Cloud Functions to make an HTTP request to a non-Google service. The free Firebase Spark Plan only allows outbound network calls to Google services. If you plan to run the sample, you will need to temporarily upgrade to a Firebase plan that allows for outbound networking, such as the [Blaze Plan](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/), also called Pay as you go.

---

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. Node.js (> v8.10)
1. Firebase CLI
1. Rocket Chat Server updated to Release 1.0.0-rc3 or later

---

### Configuration

#### Actions Console
1. From the [Actions on Google Console](https://console.actions.google.com/), add a new project > **Create Project** > under **More options** > **Conversational**
1. From the left navigation menu under **Build** > **Actions** > **Add Your First Action** > **BUILD** (this will bring you to the Dialogflow console) > Select language and time zone > **CREATE**.
1. In the Dialogflow console, go to **Settings** ⚙ > **Export and Import** > **Restore from zip** using the `agent.zip` in this sample's directory.

#### Firebase Deployment
1. [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

2. Set up and initialize the Firebase CLI. If the following command fails with an EACCES error, you may need to [change npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).

      `npm install -g firebase-tools` 

3. Authenticate the firebase tool with your Google account:

      `firebase login`

4. Clone repository to your local machine.

      `git clone https://github.com/PrajvalRaval/google-action-rocketchat.git`

+ Then, change directory to *google-action-rocketchat*.

     `cd google-action-rocketchat`

5. Initialize Firebase

      `firebase init`

6. You'll be asked to select which Firebase CLI features you want to setup for your Actions project. Choose **Functions** then press Enter to confirm and continue.

7. Associate the firebase tool with your Actions project by selecting it using the arrow keys to navigate the projects list.

+ **Note:** You can skip this step by selecting **[don't setup a default project],** but then you will need to do this association later using the command **firebase use --project**.

8. After choosing the project, the firebase tool will start the Functions setup asking you what language you want to use. Select **JavaScript** using the arrow keys and press Enter to continue.

9. For **Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style?** type **N** and press enter.

10. For **File functions/package.json already exists. Overwrite?** type **N** and press enter.

11. For **File functions/index.js already exists. Overwrite?** type **N** and press enter.

12. Get the project dependencies by typing **Y** to the prompt: 

+ **Do you want to install dependencies with npm now?**.

+ Once the setup is completed, you'll see an output similar to the following:

  `✔  Firebase initialization complete!`

13. Install the **actions-on-google** dependency by using following commands,

      `cd functions`

      `npm install actions-on-google`

14. Get the fulfillment dependencies and deploy the fulfillment function:

      `npm install`
    
    In Order to deploy our **config** we need to set some temporary Firebase Environment Variables by running the following command:
    
    ```
    firebase functions:config:set envariables.server_url="temp_url" envariables.oauth_service_name="temp_oauth" envariables.clientid="temp_clientid"
    ```
    
    Then run,

      `firebase deploy --only functions`

15. The deployment takes a few minutes. Once completed, you'll see output similar to the following. You'll need the **Function URL** to enter in Dialogflow.

```
✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/myprojectname-ab123/overview
Function URL (factsAboutGoogle): https://us-central1-myprojectname-ab123.cloudfunctions.net/dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment

```

16. In the Dialogflow console's navigation menu, click **Fulfillment**, toggle the Webhook button to **ENABLED** , and replace the url in the **URL** field with your **Function URL** that was returned after the deploy command > **SAVE**..

![dialogflow-deploy-fulfillment-00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41849970/57801680-dd573300-7771-11e9-9b28-29b38c2e92a2.png)

17. From the left navigation menu, click **Integrations** > **Integration Settings** under Google Assistant > Enable **Auto-preview changes**. (If not already enabled)

#### Enabling Billing
1. Go to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) and select your project from list.

1. In the bottom side of left menu you will see an **Upgrade** button and select **Blaze Plan** from the list.

#### Configuring Account Linking
1. Login to your [Action Developer Console](https://console.actions.google.com/) and select Rocket Chat project on the list.

2. Go to Settings ⚙ -> Project Setting and Copy **Project ID** and paste it somewere safe as we will need it later.

3. Now click on **Advance Options** on Bottom left of the screen and select **Account Linking** from the list.

4. In Account creation,

  + Select **No, I only want to allow account creation on my website** 
  
  + Click **Next**.
  
5. In Linking type, Select **OAuth** from the list and Set **Authorisation code** as grant type. Click **Next**.

6. Now we need to fill up the Authorization URI, Access Token URI, Client ID, Client Secret which we will generate on our rocket chat server.

  + **Note** You need to be admin of the server to proceed with the further steps.
  
7. In a new tab go to your **Server** -> **Three Dot Menu** -> **Administration**.

![Go to Server -> Administration](https://i.ibb.co/wgJnBxD/diagram1.jpg)

8. Click on **OAuth Apps**.

![Click on OAuth Apps](https://i.ibb.co/Wp2P42k/diagram2.jpg)

9. Click on **New Application** on top right. Now we need to give it an **Application Name** and a **Redirect URI**.

10. For Application Name use "rcgoogleaction". This can be anything else as well.

  + For the Redirect URI, copy `https://oauth-redirect.googleusercontent.com/r/YOUR_PROJECT_ID` and paste it in the Redirect URI field. **(Paste the Project Id we copied earlier here)**
  
11. You'll see it automatically generating Client ID, Client Secret, Authorization URL, and Access Token URL. Now copy these from the oauth app page and paste it in the **Client ID, Client Secret, Authorization URL** and **Access Token URL** fields in the Client information on Google Action Console Page. Click **Next**.

12. Copy **Client ID** and paste it somewhere safe as we will be using it for setting up Firebase Environent Variables.

13. In Configure your client (optional) section, 

  + Tick mark(✔) **Google to transmit clientID and secret via HTTP basic auth header**
  
  + Click **Next**.
  
14. In Testing instructions,

  + Provide an Email Id and Password as per instructions 
  
  + Click on **Save**.
  
15. We are done on setting our OAuth App which will give us the access token to use for logging in. But for that we need to also enable custom oauth login for our server which we will do in the next steps.

16. Go to your **Server -> Three Dot Menu -> Administration**. Scroll down on your left and select **OAuth** and on top right click on **Add custom OAuth**.

![Add custom OAuth](https://i.ibb.co/4jykrFx/diagram3.jpg)

17. Give a unique name in lower case for the custom oauth. For example enter "googleaction". Click on **Send**. Copy and paste this name somewhere safe as we will be using it for setting up Firebase Environent Variables.

18. You will now be provided a few fields some of which will be prefilled. We only need to change a few.

  + Change the **Enable** to **true**.
  
  + In the URL field enter `https://yourserverurl/api/v1`
  
19. Finally at the bottom switch **Merge users** to **true**. We don't need to make any other changes here.

20. Click on **Save Changes** on top.

21. Go to your console add your **Server URL,OAuth Service Name** and **Client ID** to the following command and run,

      ```
      firebase functions:config:set envariables.server_url="https://YOUR.SERVER.chat" envariables.oauth_service_name="YOUR_CUSTOM_OAUTH_NAME" envariables.clientid="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
      ````
  
  Then run,
  
     firebase deploy --only functions
  
22. Finally We Are Done !

#### AWS Lambda Deployment
The fulfillment code can also be deployed in AWS as a lambda function as an alternative to using Firebase.

1. Navigate to the AWS Lambda console.


2. Create a new function with the following settings.
    + Author From Scratch
    + Runtime: Node.js 12.x
    + Permissions: Create a new role with basic Lambda Permissions
    
    
3. Add the following Environment Variables
```
OAUTH_SERVICE_NAME => Name of the Custom OAuth service created in Rocket Chat OAuth Settings
SERVER_URL => Rocket Chat server url (https://YOUR.SERVER.chat)
```

4. Add an API Gateway trigger with the following settings.
    + Create an API
    + API Type: HTTP API
    + Security: Open
    
5. Copy the following value somewhere.
    + Click on API Gateway > Details > API endpoint
 
6. Navigate to Dialogflow > Fulfillment section: https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/agent/project_id/fulfillment
    + Paste the API endpoint in the Webhook URL field.
 
7. To upload the backend code in Lambda function
    + Navigate to `./functions` directory in the project repository
    + Select all files and compress into a zip file.
    + In the **Functions Code** section of AWS Lambda Function
    + Actions > Upload a .zip file
    + Select the compressed zip file
    + Click **Save**.

## Running this Action
+ You can test your Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device on which the Assistant is signed into the same account used to create this project. Just say or type, “OK Google, talk to my test app”.
+ You can also use the Actions on Google Console simulator to test most features and preview on-device behavior.

---

## Development 

#### Local Development Setup
The project can be run on local development for debugging. The steps are listed below.
1. Create an environment file inside the functions folder.
    + `./functions/.env`
2. Add the following variables
```
SERVER_URL=<your server url>
OAUTH_SERVICE_NAME=<custom OAuth service name>
```
3. Start the server locally by running `npm run local`
4. Create a tunnel using ngrok `ngrok http 3000`
5. Navigate to Dialogflow > Fulfillment section: https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/#/agent/project_id/fulfillment
    + Paste the URL generated by ngrok in the Webhook URL field.

#### Files
1.  `./functions/index.js`
    + Add new handlers for intents, modify intent logic to customize the skill.
    
2.  `./functions/helperFunctions.js`
    + Enhance the functionality of the source code by adding functions that are required for sending requests and various other logics.
    
3.  `./functions/config.js`
    + Imports Firebase config into our code.
    
4.  `./functions/apiEndpoints.js`
    + REST API endpoint URLs.

5.  `./functions/locales/*.json`
    + Contains responses for different locales. If you are planning to contribute to your locale you will need to change response strings here.
    
#### i18n
By default we support development for `EN`,`PT` and `HI` locales and are included in our Dialogflow agent. But we do have developed a base locale resource file for every supported Google Action locale, for developers worldwide to develop this action in their own language. If you are interested in contributing to your locale please follow this steps.

1.  Go to your [Dialogflow Console](https://console.dialogflow.com)

2.  In Dialogflow console click on `+` (Below **Settings** ⚙ Sign) > **Select Additional Language** > **Your Locale** after that click on **SAVE**

3.  Now click on <img width="47" alt="Screenshot 2019-05-20 at 8 02 57 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41849970/58029492-58d22f00-7b3a-11e9-907c-15ec033b0097.png"> and select **Your Locale** from the list.

4.  You will need to add **Training phrases** one by one to every intent. Select **Intents** > select one intent from the list > **Training phrases**. Add some training phrases that include every **Parameter** required as headers data to send a `POST` request to the server, in the utterance and make sure it is native speaker friendly.

5. While creating Training Phrases, make sure that you give composite entities parameters to the utterances. E.g. If your creating an utterance with `username` and `channelname`, select `@sys.any` as their entity type. Refer to `EN` locale training phrases for more depth understanding.

6. For Backend setup, go to `./functions/index.js` and add your locale name to `i18n.configure` > `locales` array.
    ```
    i18n.configure({
    locales: ['en-US', 'en-GB', 'en-AU', 'en-CA', 'en-IN', 'pt-BR', 'hi-IN'],
    directory: __dirname + '/locales',
    defaultLocale: 'en-US',
    objectNotation : true
    });
    ```
    **NOTE:** It is same name as in locales folder.
    
7. Locale File: `./functions/locales/*.json` ,It is highly likely that your locale may be behind because of new function additions, so we highly suggest to make sure that every object in your locale is up-to-date with our English locale file. If not make sure to add those JSON blocks to your locale before deployment. To do that simply copy and paste missing blocks from **English** locale file and simply translate the response strings into your own language.
 
We have developed those base locales using a translation software and translations of response may not be always accurate so feel free to update those response strings correctly as per your native language.
